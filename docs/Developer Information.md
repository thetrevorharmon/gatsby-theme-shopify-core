# Developer Information

This docs site uses [gatsby-theme-mdx](https://github.com/horacioh/gatsby-theme-mdx) to easily pull in MDX, Theme UI, and a syntax highlighting plugin. Because of that, it [shadows](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/) the files of that theme. That's why the directory `@horacioh` existsâ€“the package is a scoped package, and therefore needs the scope as the first folder name.
