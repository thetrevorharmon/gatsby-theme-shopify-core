import {SimpleUseCart, ExampleWithCode} from '../../components';

### useCart()

The most basic hook is the `useCart()` hook. This hook gives you access to the current cart state (or null, if there is no cart state). From this object you can get access to the line items, the total amounts, and additional checkout-related information.

<ExampleWithCode element={<SimpleUseCart />}>

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {useCart} from 'gatsby-theme-shopify-manager';

export function SimpleUseCart() {
  const cart = useCart();

  if (cart == null) {
    return <p>The cart object is currently null.</p>;
  }

  const cartDate = new Date(cart.createdAt).toLocaleDateString();

  return (
    <p>
      Your cart was created on {cartDate}.
      <br />
      You have ${cart.totalPrice} worth of products in your cart.
    </p>
  );
}
```
</ExampleWithCode>
