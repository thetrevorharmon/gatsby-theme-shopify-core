Gatsby Theme Shopify Manager is a Gatsby theme that manages the data connections between Shopify and your Gatsby storefront. All you have to do is:

1. Install the theme
2. Provide API credentials
3. Import hooks

And then start coding. ðŸš€

This is a data theme, not a UI theme. It makes setting up a Shopify cart and buyer flow simple (including managing state), so you can focus on making it look great.

## Getting Started

To start using the theme, install it with your package manager of choice:

```bash
yarn add gatsby-theme-shopify-manager gatsby-source-shopify
```

To start using it, open your `gatsby-config` file and include your Shop name and access token from the Storefront API.

```javascript
{
  resolve: `gatsby-theme-shopify-manager`,
  options: {
    shopName: 'your shop name',
    accessToken: 'your storefront API access token',
  },
},
```

The options you pass to this theme are used to configure both `gatsby-source-shopify` and the [shopify-buy](https://shopify.github.io/js-buy-sdk/) client.

### Configuration options

There are four options to configure this theme, with only the first two being required.
  
1. [shopName](/#shopname)
1. [accessToken](/#accesstoken)
1. [shouldConfigureSourcePlugin](/#shouldConfigureSourcePlugin)
1. [shouldWrapRootElementWithProvider](/#shouldwraprootelementwithprovider)

In case you're looking for a quick copy and paste ðŸ‘‡:

```javascript
{
  resolve: `gatsby-theme-shopify-manager`,
  options: {
    shopName: 'your-shop-name', // or custom domain
    accessToken: 'your-api-access-token',
    shouldConfigureSourcePlugin: false, // default
    shouldWrapRootElementWithProvider: false, // default
  },
},
```

#### shopName

This is the first part of the default Shopify domain. If your domain is `my-store.myshopify.com`, the shopName would be `my-store`. This value is required unless you pass `false` to both `shouldConfigureSourcePlugin` and `shouldWrapRootElementWithProvider`.

If you're using a custom domain with Shopify, you should enter your custom domain instead (e.g. `mystore.com`). Make sure to only include the name and domain, and omit the protocol (`http`) and any trailing slashes.
```javascript
{
  resolve: `gatsby-theme-shopify-manager`,
  options: {
    shopName: 'my-store', // or mystore.com
  },
},
```

#### accessToken

This is the Storefront API token that you get when you make a new Shopify app. This value is required unless you pass `false` to both `shouldConfigureSourcePlugin` and `shouldWrapRootElementWithProvider`.
```javascript
{
  resolve: `gatsby-theme-shopify-manager`,
  options: {
    accessToken: '12lg(@!l129gj12p['
  },
},
```

#### shouldConfigureSourcePlugin

By default, `gatsby-theme-shopify-manager` passes a configuration object to the `gatsby-source-shopify` plugin in `gatsby-config`. If you need to do advanced configuration of that plugin, pass `false` to this option. From there, you can set up and configure your source plugin as you please.
```javascript
{
  resolve: `gatsby-theme-shopify-manager`,
  options: {
    // default value is true
    shouldConfigureSourcePlugin: false
  },
},
```

#### shouldWrapRootElementWithProvider

By default, `gatsby-theme-shopify-manager` wraps the application in a `<ContextProvider>`, and passes the `shopName` and `accessToken` provided to the theme options through to the provider. Pass `false` to this option to prevent this behavior.
```javascript
{
  resolve: `gatsby-theme-shopify-manager`,
  options: {
    // default value is true
    shouldWrapRootElementWithProvider: false
  },
},
```

## Context Provider

The Shopify buy client and current cart state are managed using React context. By default, the application is wrapped by the Provider and the `shopName` and `accessToken` are pulled from the config options and passed to it. However, in some cases, it might be preferable to manage the provider.

> By default, `gatsby-theme-shopify-manager` wraps the application in a provider. If you want to manage this yourself, pass `shouldWrapRootElementWithProvider: false` to the theme options. If you don't, you'll have multiple providers that may result in unintended side-effects.

To use the provider, import it and pass `shopName` and `accessToken` to it as props.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {ContextProvider} from 'gatsby-theme-shopify-manager';
export const App = ({children}) => {
  const shopName = 'some-shop-name';
  const accessToken = 'some-access-token';

  return (
    <ContextProvider shopName={shopName} accessToken={accessToken}>
      {children}
    </ContextProvider>
  );
};
```

## Hooks

The main export of this package are the hooks that you can use. Here are the hooks you can use:

<Hooks />

## Escape Hooks

In addition to the normal hooks, there are two 'escape' hooks. These hooks allow access to setting the cart state and the client object that is used to interact with Shopify. It's important to note that these are considered experiementalâ€“**using these hooks may result in unintended side-effects.**

### useClientUnsafe

The `useClientUnsafe` hook returns the client object currently held in the context. From there you can call methods on it to enable more functionality. Shopify has all [the documentation](https://shopify.github.io/js-buy-sdk/) for what you can do with the client object. Example usage:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {useClientUnsafe} from 'gatsby-theme-shopify-manager';

export function ExampleUseClientUnsafe() {
  const client = useClientUnsafe();
  // do work with the client here
}
```

### useSetCartUnsafe

The `useSetCartUnsafe` returns a function that allows the user to set the current cart state. You can use it similar to the function returned from a `useState` destructure. This is useful for interactions with the `client` object that return an updated cart object. Example usage:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {useClientUnsafe, useSetCartUnsafe} from 'gatsby-theme-shopify-manager';

export function ExampleUseSetCartUnsafe() {
  const client = useClientUnsafe();
  const setCart = useSetCartUnsafe();

  async function changeCart() {
    const newCart = await client.doSomeMethodThatReturnsACartObject();
    setCart(newCart);
  }

  changeCart();
}
```

## Examples

<Card
  sx={{
    mt: 3,
    maxWidth: 400,
  }}>
  <Image sx={{width: '100%'}} src={OnlyDownExample} />
  <Text sx={{px: 3, py: 1}}>
    <Styled.h4
      as={Link}
      url="https://only-down-manager-example.netlify.app"
    >
      Only Down
    </Styled.h4>
    <p>Only Down is an example site that shows how to use the gatsby-theme-shopify-manager plugin.</p>
