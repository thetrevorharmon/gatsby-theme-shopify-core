## Getting Started

To start using the theme, install it with your package manager of choice:

```bash
yarn add gatsby-theme-shopify-manager
```

To start using it, open your `gatsby-config` file and include your Shop name and access token from the Storefront API.

```javascript
{
  resolve: `gatsby-theme-shopify-manager`,
  options: {
    shopName: 'your shop name',
    accessToken: 'your storefront API access token',
  },
},
```

When you use this theme, it automatically includes `gatsby-source-shopify` and sets it up for you. These options are passed to that package, as well as used internally to create a connection to Shopify using [shopify-buy](https://shopify.github.io/js-buy-sdk/). Once you've set up the plugin, you're ready to start using

<ExampleWithCode element={<SimpleCartExample />}>

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {useCart} from 'gatsby-theme-shopify-manager';

export function SimpleCartExample() {
  const cart = useCart();

  if (cart == null || cart.lineItems.length < 1) {
    return <p>Your cart is empty.</p>;
  }

  return (
    <>
      <p>Your cart has {cart.lineItems.length} items.</p>
      <ul>
        {cart.lineItems.map((lineItem) => (
          <li key={lineItem.title}>
            {lineItem.title} - {lineItem.variant.title}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```
